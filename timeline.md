title: "COVID on campuses: a history"
permalink: /timeline
---
As the coronavirus spread across the United States and campuses made --- and revised --- their policies for labor and learning, student journalists documented these events and their impact on their local communities. 

Student newspapers reveal how student life has gone on alongside changes in living and learning, and show how students have joined forces with faculty and staff to fight for their health and their right to learn.

    	<p>This timeline records the events of the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on university students, as told by students themselves. The timeline draws on student newspapers at community colleges, public universities, and liberal arts colleges across the United States to paint a broad picture of how universities responded to the pandemic, and how students have stepped up to support their community during unprecedented times.<br><br>
    	This timeline is based on articles from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R9XvbssNDxQ1xV8xWM83mjrf-BIRWuGfvCpm5dB-UzA/edit?usp=sharing"> COVID Campus News Database.</a> <br><br>

    <p>The VFC is building timelines of student news outlets reporting on university plans during the pandemic. We'll be working with student newspaper organizations and advocating for others to create timelines of their student newspapers. Stay tuned for a few timeline examples from around the country, and keep on the lookout for our newsletter!</p>
