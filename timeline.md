    <h2>General Timeline: What Happened?</h2>
    	<p><img src="/img/vfc.timeline.wh.png"></p>
    	<p>This timeline records the events of the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on university students, as told by students themselves. The timeline draws on student newspapers at community colleges, public universities, and liberal arts colleges across the United States to paint a broad picture of how universities responded to the pandemic, and how students have stepped up to support their community during unprecedented times.<br>
    	This timeline is based on articles from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R9XvbssNDxQ1xV8xWM83mjrf-BIRWuGfvCpm5dB-UzA/edit?usp=sharing"> COVID Campus News Database.</a> <br>
    	Designed by Hannah Alpert-Abrams and the VFC. </p>

    <h2>Regional Spotlight: Boston</h2>
    <p>The VFC is building timelines of student news outlets reporting on university plans during the pandemic. We'll be working with student newspaper organizations and advocating for others to create timelines of their student newspapers. Stay tuned for a few timeline examples from around the country, and keep on the lookout for our newsletter!</p>

    <h2>#COVIDCampus Mapping</h2>
	<p>The VFC will be designing and publishing data visualizations with the goal of making visible the shifting discourse around campus closings and reopenings, and the ways that life, labor, and economics are manipulated in the name of access to higher education. </p>
	<p> Our intention is to map and visualize data that can have an impact on how we approach and manage the Fall 2020 semester.</p>

# #COVIDCampus: The Project
As the coronavirus spread across the United States and campuses made --- and revised --- their policies for labor and learning, student journalists documented these events and their impact on their local communities. 

Student newspapers reveal how student life has gone on alongside changes in living and learning, and show how students have joined forces with faculty and staff to fight for their health and their right to learn.

# #COVIDCampus: The Data

We are building a database of student newspaper reports on COVID-19. [Click here for instructions on how to help us collect data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R9XvbssNDxQ1xV8xWM83mjrf-BIRWuGfvCpm5dB-UzA/edit). 

You are also welcome to use our data set to make your own timeline (or do your own research). Intructions on how to make a timeline for your campus are forthcoming. Email us at visionaryfuturescollective@gmail.com to learn more or to add your timeline to our website!
