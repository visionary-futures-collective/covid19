# The College Crisis

Since the start of the pandemic, a wide array of organizations have been tracking the spread of the disease and its impact on various industries. The intersection of COVID and university studies has led to interesting work, including data-based analyses of reopening plans and digital storytelling such as a choose-your-own-adventure game. 

# Visualizing the Return to Campus at Scale

The <a href="https://www.english-corpora.org/corona/help/corpus.asp">Coronavirus Corpus</a> is designed to be the definitive record of the social, cultural, and economic impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2020 and beyond. <a href="https://covidtracking.com/">Covid Tracking</a> collects data on the spread of COVID-19.

Inside Higher Ed is tracking ["https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/04/27/colleges-rev-cuts-pandemic-related-costs-keep-mounting#.Xqbt42OdgMI.email"](the economic fallout) of the COVID-19 pandemic in academic institutions. Karen Kelsky of "The Professor is In" is also recording hiring freezes since March.

The [College Crisis Initiative](https://collegecrisis.org/) is an undergraduate intitiative collecting and visualizing data on campus reopenings, focusing on four-year institutions. Their data and visualizations may be the most comprehensive.  

# Bearing Witness and Rewriting the Narrative

[Bearing Witness](https://bearingwitness.github.io/) is an effort to document and interpret the events associated with the novel coronavirus epidemic in the United States as it pertains to racialized minorities. 

[University of Miami’s digital humanities team](https://covid.dh.miami.edu/team/) is likewise working to shift the narrative on the return to campus.

For a digital storytelling project exploring the return to campus, check out this [choose-your-own-adventure game](https://caitkirby.com/downloads/Fall%202020.html).

# Advocating for Change and an Alternate Future

Bess Williamson’s [accessibility policy statements](https://sites.google.com/view/accesscampusalliance/home) for return to campus during the pandemic have played a crucial role in many attempts to negotiate with university administrations.

Georgia Tech’s [“COVID-19 Event Risk Planning Tool”](https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu/) also offers useful resources for advocacy. 

[Humanist Mutual Aid](https://humanistmutualaid.com/) is an initiative to bring together workers in higher education for mutual support.
