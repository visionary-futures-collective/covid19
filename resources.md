## The College Crisis

Since the start of the pandemic, a wide array of organizations have been tracking the spread of the disease and its impact on various industries. The intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic and university studies has led to interesting work, including data-based analyses of reopening plans and digital storytelling such as a choose-your-own-adventure game. 

## Visualizing the Return to Campus at Scale

The [Coronavirus Corpus](https://www.english-corpora.org/corona/help/corpus.asp) is designed to be the definitive record of the social, cultural, and economic impact of the COVID in 2020 and beyond. [Covid Tracking](https://covidtracking.com) collects data on the spread of COVID-19. Various websites are [mapping](https://www.covidexitstrategy.org/) the spread of pandemic in the United States.   

The Chronicle of Higher Education is currently [tracking over 1000 colleges’ plans for reopening](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Here-s-a-List-of-Colleges-/248626?cid=wcontentgrid_hp_1b) in the fall. The Chronicle is also exploring the data in terms of [university type](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Has-Reopening-Become-a/248932?key=wYmokCnDzR4h9eFNudrs4vQzbZ_gy7CjCxh3pmwiEluXouthoZenLEP-Bm5huYHhQzlTQU0yRU1uV04tWE00bGVlOFAweXFnLW5STzMxNkR1S3dXTUE3Nkdsdw). [Visualizations of the Chronicle's data on reopening](https://philonedtech.com/visualizing-fall-2020-us-higher-education-plans/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=visualizing-fall-2020-us-higher-education-plans) have been made available, as well as this [data visualization of the “Top 100” Universities’ Fall Plans](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZDRiMWQxODAtN2ZjMi00NGNlLWFjMDItYzhjN2JlZTI5ODBmIiwidCI6ImI4MmMxNGFhLTM1MWQtNGFkNC1hNGRiLTVlOGE5OGQ4NWM4OSIsImMiOjl9).    

Inside Higher Ed is tracking [the economic fallout](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/04/27/colleges-rev-cuts-pandemic-related-costs-keep-mounting#.Xqbt42OdgMI.email) of the COVID-19 pandemic in academic institutions. Karen Kelsky of "The Professor is In" is also recording hiring freezes since March.

The [College Crisis Initiative](https://collegecrisis.org/) is an undergraduate intitiative collecting and visualizing data on campus reopenings, focusing on four-year institutions. Their data and visualizations may be the most comprehensive.

## Bearing Witness and Rewriting the Narrative

[Bearing Witness](https://bearingwitness.github.io/) is an effort to document and interpret the events associated with the novel coronavirus epidemic in the United States as it pertains to racialized minorities.

[University of Miami’s digital humanities team](https://covid.dh.miami.edu/team/) is likewise working to shift the narrative on the return to campus.
 
For a digital storytelling project exploring the return to campus, check out this [choose-your-own-adventure game](https://caitkirby.com/downloads/Fall%202020.html). 

## Advocating for Change and an Alternate Future

Bess Williamson’s [accessibility policy statements](https://sites.google.com/view/accesscampusalliance/home) for return to campus during the pandemic have played a crucial role in many attempts to negotiate with university administrations.

Georgia Tech’s [“COVID-19 Event Risk Planning Tool”](https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu/) also offers useful resources for advocacy.

[Humanist Mutual Aid](https://humanistmutualaid.com/) is an initiative to bring together workers in higher education for mutual support.
