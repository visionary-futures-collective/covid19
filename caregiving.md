# Welcome to the Caregivers Survey

A VFC effort to bring visibility to working conditions for caregivers on campuses during the coronavirus pandemic.

Caregivers are people who have at-home care responsibilities: for children, for parents, for siblings, for partners, for other loved ones. With the collapse of external caregiving resources, like schools, elder-care facilities, and offices, many of us are being asked to shoulder an impossible burden: full-time care and full-time work.

This project focuses on the students and staff who are serving as caregivers while working on college campuses, from TAs to tenured professors, librarians, adjunct instructors, and administrative staff.

# 1. Caregivers feel abandoned by their institutions

We asked caregivers to answer the question: "How do you feel about your university's caregiver policies during the pandemic?"

Here's what you told us.

<!-- 

Respondents could choose between Abandoned (47.22%), Somewhat Supported (39.68%), Adequately Supported (11.9%), and Fully Supported (1.19%).  

We're not going to lie: it's painful to see how many of you feel fully abandoned by your workplace.

# 2. Institutions aren't doing enough
We asked caregivers what actions their institutions were taking to support them.

<!-- 
We identified sixteen different ways that institutions can support caregivers, ranging from acknowledging the emotional costs of caregiving to offering work from home, FMLA leave, or financial support.  

[View the responses, broken down by institution, here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eQhgq3aKu699FWvimjtBMzLPnJIekMlVBFw1DAyrW18/edit?usp=sharing)

We asked respondents which of those sixteen modes of support they had received from their institutions. *The numbers overwhelmingly show that institutions are not offering most, if any, of these provisions.*

Workers from only 41% of institutions reported having the option of work from home or flexible work schedules.

Only 16% reported FMLA mandated leave, while a mere 17% reported that their institutions had acknowledged the emotional impact of caregiving on their workers.

### Other accommodations
A number of respondents described other ways that they are being supported that are not included in the survey, such as:
* Ability to delay / take early scheduled leave
* Ability to manipulate policies on behalf of supervisees
* Assignment of TAs or RAs
* Reduced service responsibilities
* Nothing, Absolutely nothing, nothing at all.
* "I was forced to quit."

### Caveats
* We only asked for positive responses, not negative responses, so we don't know for sure that institutions aren't providing other resources to some of their staff. 
* The spreadsheet summarizes the responses by institution, and omits responses that don't name an institution. We are working on ways to provide a more complete picture of responses.
* We didn't break down the data by position, though we know that people in different kinds of jobs received wildly different options.

# 3. Caregivers are struggling

<!-- We left a space for further comments and so, so many of you shared heartbreaking stories of your struggles. We are thinking of ways to meaningfully share this information, but here are just a few examples:
* "While I can do my job from home I don't think I'll be allowed to. I feel totally abandoned by the university and like they will just want me to quit, which I can't afford."
* "There is absolutely no support whatsoever for caregivers that do not fit normative ideals of what families look like. We are struggling."
* "Caregiving knows no age boundaries, and can be needed at any time. American policies on family care are not only unfair, but they almost entirely ignore care for ADULTS as a responsibility."
* "The scope of care giving responsibilities have changed in our home in ways that are not legible to the institution."
* "I can't express how completely abandoned I feel by my university even as it produces research that demonstrates how care giving has impacted women's mental health."
* "We are also furloughed."
* "The desperation is real and pressing."

# About the survey

We're collecting data on caregiver experiences at universities across the United States and internationally.

<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6iRSlr7DJXthJwENxXTjTa3jPiFVqOI9RsNqu-1LZbhw2Xg/viewform?usp=sf_link">View the survey. </a>

We're still in the process of collecting and validating data. But events are moving too quickly for us to sit by and wait, so we're posting preliminary information in real time as we receive it. 

Last update: October 24, 2020. Responses: 252. Institutions: 121.

## About the data

This data represents the results of a survey that has been circulated via social media since early October, 2020. The survey was updated once, on October 14, to collect more nuanced information. We are only showing results here that can be calculated across both versions.

Data about institutions has been combined and simplified. If a respondent wrote that an accommodation was available but not accessible, we did not report it. We only require one positive response, however, to consider an accommodation available, even if we received conflicting results (as was often the case when people with different job titles replied).

We received a lot of information that is not yet available on this website, including information from people who didn't specify an institution, and details about where resources are coming from. We're working on it.

## About the respondents

Our respondents so far have largely been securely employed, and a majority are concerned with childcare, though a number of you have adults or elders who you care for as well. Student workers, as well as contingent and precarious workers, are underrepresented in this survey, perhaps because they don't have time to take it. 

The majority of respondents (about 40%) are caring for one or more child age 6-12, while about 20% are caring for adults.

<br>
<br>
The majority of respondents (about 40%) are tenured faculty, followed by tenure track faculty, administrative staff, or permanent librarians.<br>
<img src="img/caregiver-jobs-10-24.png" alt="Caregiver Jobs Chart" width="500"/>
<br>
<br>
More than 60% of respondents are in permanent roles, which means their jobs don't have a fixed end date. About twenty percent are on term-limited contracts, while the remainder are precarious (i.e. adjuncting), students, or at-will employees. <br>
