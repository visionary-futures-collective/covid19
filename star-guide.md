How are you all feeling today? 

Me too.

It's been a week. I've been in the mountains, hanging out with Pikas and pretending that none of this is happening. But I came back down to hear that my dad might have COVID (his test came back negative, but who knows), students are starting to move back to their campuses, and now what I am feeling is discouraged. 

Anyway, I guess what I'm saying is, welcome to the VFC star guide, your place to share feelings about higher education in pandemic times, to build community, to dream of a better future, and to take action.

Here's what we're doing: sign up to receive the VFC Star Guide, a weekly horoscope from the Visionary Futures Collective.

The Star Guide is one part astrology, one part data collection, three parts solidarity. Each week, we'll be taking the pulse of our community's collective mood by inviting you to answer low-stakes questions about your feelings. We'll be collaborating with artists and writers to provide a weekly academic horoscope, something to help you see through the haze into a better future. We'll be collecting and sharing stories from around the world of university workers and students fighting for positive change. And we'll be providing you with low-stakes actions you can take to help provide support to the academic community.

Whew, I'm feeling better. Hope you are too.
